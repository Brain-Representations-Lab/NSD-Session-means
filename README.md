# NSD-Session-means
nsd session by voxel matrices for each NSD participant

betas files from 
betas_fithrf_GLMdenoise_RR (beta version 3; b3) â€“ GLM in which the HRF is estimated for each voxel, the GLMdenoise technique is used for denoising, and ridge regression is used to better estimate the single-trial betas.
